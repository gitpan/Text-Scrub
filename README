1.0 SCOPE
    This paragraph identifies and provides an overview of the released
    files.

  1.1 Identification

    This release, identified in 3.2, is a collection of Perl modules that
    extend the capabilities of the Perl language.

  1.2 System overview

    The "Text::Scrub" module extends the Perl language (the system).

    When comparing text there are small snippets such as version numbers and
    dates that should be wild carded out and not influence the comparisions.
    The Test::STD:Scrub module replaces these small snippets with invariant
    snippet. By replacing the same part of each file with the same invariant
    snippet, those small sections of text are effectively wild carded for
    the comparisions.

    When performing tests, the ability to wild card small snippets of text
    is vital in making accurate comparison. The same capability is also
    essential for version control in comparing two pieces of software to see
    if there are significant changes.

  1.3 Document overview.

    This document releases Text::Scrub version 0.01 providing a description
    of the inventory, installation instructions and other information
    necessary to utilize and track this release.

        Rename Module

            that I would like you to reconsider is the naming of
            "Test::TestUtil" respectively "Test::Tech" - neither of those is
            descriptive of what the routines actually do or what the module
            implements. I would recommend renaming them to something closer
            to your other modules, maybe "Test::SVDMaker::Util" and
            "Test::SVDMaker::Tech", as some routines do not seem to be
            specific to the Test::-suite but rather general
            (format_array_table). Some parts (the "scrub" routines) might
            even better live in another module namespace,
            "Test::Util::ScrubData" or something like that.

            Broke away the "scrub" routines from Test::TestUtil created this
            module Test::STD::Scrub.

        new methods
            Added the scrub_data and scrub_probe methods

    Test::STD::Scrub 0.02
        Use the new modules from the break-up of the "File::FileUtil" module

    Text::Scrub 0.01
        Moved to a more appropriate library location.

  3.4 Adaptation data.

    This installation requires that the installation site has the Perl
    programming language installed. Installation sites running Microsoft
    Operating systems require the installation of Unix utilities. An
    excellent, highly recommended Unix utilities for Microsoft operating
    systems is unxutils by Karl M. Syring. A copy is available at the
    following web sites:

     http://unxutils.sourceforge.net
     http://packages.SoftwareDiamnds.com

    There are no other additional requirements or tailoring needed of
    configurations files, adaptation data or other software needed for this
    installation particular to any installation site.

  3.5 Related documents.

    There are no related documents needed for the installation and test of
    this release.

  3.6 Installation instructions.

    Instructions for installation, installation tests and installation
    support are as follows:

    Installation Instructions.

        None.

    Installation Tests.

        script(s) as part of the installation:

  3.7 Possible problems and known errors

    There is still much work needed to ensure the quality of this module as
    follows:

    *   State the functional requirements for each method including not only
        the GO paths but also what to expect for the NOGO paths

    *   All the tests are GO path tests. Should add NOGO tests.

    *   Add the requirements addressed as *# R: * comment to the tests

    *   Write a program to build a matrix to trace test step to the
        requirements and vice versa by parsing the *# R: * comments.
        Automatically insert the matrix in the Test::TestUtil POD.
