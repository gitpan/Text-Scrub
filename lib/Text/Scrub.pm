=head1 NAME
  
Text::STDutil - used to wild card out text used for comparison

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Text::Scrub

  $scrubbed_text = Text::Scrub->scrub_date($script_text)
  $scrubbed_text = Text::Scrub->scrub_date_ticket($script_text)
  $scrubbed_text = Text::Scrub->scrub_date_version($script_text)
  $scrubbed_text = Text::Scrub->scrub_file_line($script_text)
  $scrubbed_text = Text::Scrub->scrub_probe($script_text)
  $scrubbed_text = Text::Scrub->scrub_test_file($script_text)

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The methods in the C<Test::STD:Scrub> package are designed to support the
L<C<Test::STDmaker>|Test::STDmaker> and 
the L<C<ExtUtils::SVDmaker>|ExtUtils::SVDmaker> package.
This is the focus and no other focus.
Since C<Test::STD::Scrub> is a separate package, the methods
may be used elsewhere.
In all likehood, any revisions will maintain backwards compatibility
with previous revisions.
However, support and the performance of the 
L<C<Test::STDmaker>|Test::STDmaker> and 
L<C<ExtUtils::SVDmaker>|ExtUtils::SVDmaker> packages has
priority over backwards compatibility.

=head2 scrub_date_ticket

 $scrubbed_text = Test::STD::Scrub->scrub_date_ticket($script_text)

When comparing the contents of email messages, 
the date and email ticket should not be used 
in the comparision. 
The I<scrub_date_ticket> method will replace
the date and email ticket with a generic value.
Applying the I<scrub_date_ticket> to the contents
of both files before the comparision will 
eliminate the data and ticket as factors in
the comparision.

For example,

 ==> $text

 Date: Feb 6 00 00 00 1969 +0000
 Subject: 20030506, This Week in Health
 X-SDticket: 20030205
 X-eudora-date: Feb 6 2000 00 00 2003 +0000
 X-SDmailit: dead Feb 5 2000 00 00 2003
 Sent email 20030205 to support.softwarediamonds.com
 
 ==> Test::STD::Scrub->scrub_date_ticket($text)

 Date: Feb 6 00 00 00 1969 +0000
 Subject: XXXXXXXXX-X,  This Week in Health'
 X-SDticket: XXXXXXXXX-X
 X-eudora-date: Feb 6 00 00 00 1969 +0000
 X-SDmailit: dead Sat Feb 6 00 00 00 1969 +0000
 Sent email XXXXXXXXX-X to support.softwarediamonds.com

=head2 scrub_date_version

 $scrubbed_text = Test::STD::Scrub->scrub_date_version($script_text)

When comparing the contents of two Perl program modules, 
the date and version should not be used 
in the comparision. 
The I<scrub_date_ticket> method will replace
the date and version with a generic value.
Applying the I<scrub_date_ticket> to the contents
of both files before the comparision will 
eliminate the date and version as factors in
the comparision.

For example,

 ==> $text

 $VERSION = \'0.01\';
 $DATE = \'2003/06/07\';

 ==> Test::STD::Scrub->scrub_date_version($text)

 $VERSION = '0.00;
 $DATE = 'Feb 6, 1969';

=head2 scrub_file_line

 $scrubbed_text = Test::STD::Scrub->scrub_file_line($script_text)

When comparing the ouput of I<Test> module
the file and line number should not be used 
in the comparision. 
The I<scrub_file_line> method will replace
the file and line with a generic value.
Applying the I<scrub_file_line> to the contents
of both files before the comparision will 
eliminate the file and line as factors in
the comparision.

For example,

 ==> $text 

 ok 2 # (E:/User/SoftwareDiamonds/installation/t/Test/STDmaker/tgA1.t at line 123 TODO?!)';

 ==> Test::STD::Scrub->scrub_file_line($text)

 ok 2 # (xxxx.t at line 000 TODO?!)

=head2 scrub_test_file

 $scrubbed_text = Test::STD::Scrub->scrub_test_file($script_text)

When comparing the ouput of I<Test:Harness> module
the test file should not be used 
in the comparision. 
The I<scrub_test_file> method will replace
the test file with a generic value.
Applying the I<scrub_test_file> to the contents
of both files before the comparision will 
eliminate the test file as a factor in
the comparision.

For example,

 ==>$text

 Running Tests\n\nE:/User/SoftwareDiamonds/installation/t/Test/STDmaker/tgA1.1..16 todo 2 5;

 ==> Test::STD::Scrub->scrub_test_file($text)

 Running Tests xxx.t 1..16 todo 2 5;
