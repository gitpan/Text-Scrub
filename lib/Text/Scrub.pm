=head1 DESCRIPTION

The methods in the C<Test::STD:Scrub> package are designed to support the
L<C<Test::STDmaker>|Test::STDmaker> and 
the L<C<ExtUtils::SVDmaker>|ExtUtils::SVDmaker> package.
This is the focus and no other focus.
Since C<Test::STD::Scrub> is a separate package, the methods
may be used elsewhere.
In all likehood, any revisions will maintain backwards compatibility
with previous revisions.
However, support and the performance of the 
L<C<Test::STDmaker>|Test::STDmaker> and 
L<C<ExtUtils::SVDmaker>|ExtUtils::SVDmaker> packages has
priority over backwards compatibility.

=head2 scrub_date_ticket

 $scrubbed_text = Test::STD::Scrub->scrub_date_ticket($script_text)

When comparing the contents of email messages, 
the date and email ticket should not be used 
in the comparision. 
The I<scrub_date_ticket> method will replace
the date and email ticket with a generic value.
Applying the I<scrub_date_ticket> to the contents
of both files before the comparision will 
eliminate the data and ticket as factors in
the comparision.

=head2 scrub_date_version

 $scrubbed_text = Test::STD::Scrub->scrub_date_version($script_text)

When comparing the contents of two Perl program modules, 
the date and version should not be used 
in the comparision. 
The I<scrub_date_ticket> method will replace
the date and version with a generic value.
Applying the I<scrub_date_ticket> to the contents
of both files before the comparision will 
eliminate the date and version as factors in
the comparision.

=head2 scrub_file_line

 $scrubbed_text = Test::STD::Scrub->scrub_file_line($script_text)

When comparing the ouput of I<Test> module
the file and line number should not be used 
in the comparision. 
The I<scrub_file_line> method will replace
the file and line with a generic value.
Applying the I<scrub_file_line> to the contents
of both files before the comparision will 
eliminate the file and line as factors in
the comparision.

=head2 scrub_test_file

 $scrubbed_text = Test::STD::Scrub->scrub_test_file($script_text)

When comparing the ouput of I<Test:Harness> module
the test file should not be used 
in the comparision. 
The I<scrub_test_file> method will replace
the test file with a generic value.
Applying the I<scrub_test_file> to the contents
of both files before the comparision will 
eliminate the test file as a factor in
the comparision.

=head1 QUALITY ASSURANCE

Running the test script 'Scrub.t' found in
the "Text-Scrub-$VERSION.tar.gz" distribution file verifies
the requirements for this module.

All testing software and documentation
stems from the 
Software Test Description (L<STD|Docs::US_DOD::STD>)
program module 't::Text::Scrub',
found in the distribution file 
"Text-Scrub-$VERSION.tar.gz". 

The 't::Text::Scrub' L<STD|Docs::US_DOD::STD> POD contains
a tracebility matix between the
requirements established above for this module, and
the test steps identified by a
'ok' number from running the 'Scrub.t'
test script.

The t::Text::Scrub' L<STD|Docs::US_DOD::STD>
program module '__DATA__' section contains the data 
to perform the following:

=over 4

=item *

to generate the test script 'Scrub.t'

=item *

generate the tailored 
L<STD|Docs::US_DOD::STD> POD in
the 't::Text::Scrub' module, 

=item *

generate the 'Scrub.d' demo script, 

=item *

Replace the POD demonstration section
herein with the demo script
'Scrub.d' output, and

=item *

run the test script using Test::Harness
with or without the verbose option,

=back

To perform all the above, prepare
and run the automation software as 
follows:

=over 4

=item *

Install "Test_STDmaker-$VERSION.tar.gz"
from one of the respositories only
if it has not been installed:

=over 4

=item *

http://www.softwarediamonds/packages/

=item *

http://www.perl.com/CPAN-local/authors/id/S/SO/SOFTDIA/

=back
  
=item *

manually place the script tmake.pl
in "Test_STDmaker-$VERSION.tar.gz' in
the site operating system executable 
path only if it is not in the 
executable path

=item *

place the 't::Text::Scrub' at the same
level in the directory struture as the
directory holding the 'Text::Scrub'
module

=item *

execute the following in any directory:

 tmake -test_verbose -replace -run -pm=t::Text::Scrub

=back

=head1 NOTES

=head2 FILES

The installation of the
"Text-Scrub-$VERSION.tar.gz" distribution file
installs the 'Docs::Site_SVD::Text_Scrub'
L<SVD|Docs::US_DOD::SVD> program module.

The __DATA__ data section of the 
'Docs::Site_SVD::Text_Scrub' contains all
the necessary data to generate the POD
section of 'Docs::Site_SVD::Text_Scrub' and
the "Text-Scrub-$VERSION.tar.gz" distribution file.

To make use of the 
'Docs::Site_SVD::Text_Scrub'
L<SVD|Docs::US_DOD::SVD> program module,
perform the following:

=over 4

=item *

install "ExtUtils-SVDmaker-$VERSION.tar.gz"
from one of the respositories only
if it has not been installed:

=over 4

=item *

http://www.softwarediamonds/packages/

=item *

http://www.perl.com/CPAN-local/authors/id/S/SO/SOFTDIA/

=back

=item *

manually place the script vmake.pl
in "ExtUtils-SVDmaker-$VERSION.tar.gz' in
the site operating system executable 
path only if it is not in the 
executable path

=item *

Make any appropriate changes to the
__DATA__ section of the 'Docs::Site_SVD::Text_Scrub'
module.
For example, any changes to
'Text::Scrub' will impact the
at least 'Changes' field.

=item *

Execute the following:

 vmake readme_html all -pm=Docs::Site_SVD::Text_Scrub
