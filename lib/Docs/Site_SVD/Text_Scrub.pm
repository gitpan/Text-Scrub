=head1 1.0 SCOPE

This paragraph identifies and provides an overview
of the released files.

=head2 1.1 Identification

This release,
identified in L<3.2|/3.2 Inventory of software contents>,
is a collection of Perl modules that
extend the capabilities of the Perl language.

=head2 1.2 System overview

The "L<Text::Scrub|Text::Scrub>" module extends the Perl language (the system).

When comparing text there are small snippets such as version numbers and dates
that should be wild carded out and not influence the comparisions.
The Test::STD:Scrub module replaces these small snippets with invariant snippet.
By replacing the same part of each file with the same invariant snippet,
those small sections of text are effectively wild carded for the comparisions.

When performing tests, the ability to wild card small snippets of text is
vital in making accurate comparison. 
The same capability is also essential for version control in comparing two
pieces of software to see if there are significant changes.

=head2 1.3 Document overview.

This document releases Text::Scrub version 0.07
providing a description of the inventory, installation
instructions and other information necessary to
utilize and track this release.

=head1 3.0 VERSION DESCRIPTION

All file specifications in this SVD
use the Unix operating
system file specification.

parts (the "scrub" routines) might even better live in another

Broke away the "scrub" routines from Test::TestUtil

=item Text-Scrub-0.02

Change the test so that test support program modules resides in distribution
directory tlib directory instead of the lib directory. 
Because they are no longer in the lib directory, 
test support files will not be installed as a pre-condition for the 
test of this module.
The test of this module will precede immediately.
The test support files in the tlib directory will vanish after
the installtion.

Recreate distribution file 
with Archive::TarGzip 0.02 that uses mode 777 for directories instead of 666. Started to get
emails from Unix installers about untar not being able to change to
a directory with mode of 666.

=item Text-Scrub-0.04

Changes the 'stringify' module for 'Test-Tech' from
'Data::Strify' to 'Data::Secs2'.

=item Text-Scrub-0.05

The lastest build of Test::STDmaker expects the test library in the same
directory as the test script.
Coordiated with the lastest Test::STDmaker by moving the
test library from tlib to t/Text, the same directory as the test script
and deleting the test library File::TestPath program module.

Added "SEE ALSO" section. Reworked QUALITY ASSURANCE and NOTES sections.

=item Text-Scrub-0.06

Cleaned up POD. Add C<scrub_architect> to C<OK_EXPORT>.
